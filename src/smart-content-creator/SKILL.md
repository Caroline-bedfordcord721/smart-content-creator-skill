# Content Synthesizer

## Overview

This skill transforms reading materials and personal insights into polished, shareable content across multiple formats - from text to visual representations. It bridges the gap between understanding and expression, helping users articulate their learning in natural, engaging ways.

**Core Principle**: Generate content that reads naturally and authentically, avoiding robotic AI patterns. Every output should feel like it was created by a thoughtful human, not generated by a machine.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when users want to:
- Convert reading notes into blog posts or articles
- Create social media content from insights
- Visualize knowledge with mind maps or infographics
- Generate charts and diagrams to illustrate concepts
- Share learning insights in specific formats
- Transform deep analysis into accessible content

**Trigger phrases**:
- "Turn this into a blog post"
- "Create a Xiaohongshu note about..."
- "Make a mind map of..."
- "Visualize these concepts"
- "Create an infographic description"
- "Write a Twitter article about..."
- "Generate a chart/diagram of..."
- "Help me share this learning"

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Input

**Required Information**:
- Source material (article, paper, book excerpt)
- User's insights and understanding
- Target format (blog, social media, visualization, etc.)
- Optional: Target audience, language preference

**If missing source material**:
```
I'd love to help you create content! To get started, I need:

1. The original material you read (article link, text, or summary)
2. Your key takeaways and insights
3. What format you'd like (blog, social media, visualization, etc.)

Share what you have and we'll work from there.
```

**If user has Deep Reading Analyst results**:
Acknowledge and build upon their analysis seamlessly:
```
Great! I can see you've done a thorough analysis. Let me transform 
this into [requested format] while preserving your insights.
```

### Step 2: Understand Context

**Quick assessment**:
- What's the user's goal? (teach, share, document, visualize, promote)
- Who's the audience? (experts, beginners, general public)
- What's the tone? (professional, casual, academic, conversational)
- Any platform constraints? (word count, character limits, image specs)
- Visual or textual focus? (diagrams vs prose)

**Clarifying questions** (only ask what's essential):
```
To create the best [format] for you:
- Who's your target audience?
- What tone works best? (I can show you style options)
- Any specific points you want to emphasize?
- For visualizations: What relationships are most important?
```

### Step 3: Identify User Voice and Depth Needs

**CRITICAL**: Before choosing any style, understand the user's authentic voice and desired depth level.

**Capture personal voice**:
Load `references/personal_voice_guide.md` for voice identification techniques.

Observe:
- How does the user naturally express themselves?
- What's their thinking style? (analytical, narrative, systems, etc.)
- What personality markers appear? (skeptical, enthusiastic, pragmatic, etc.)
- What sentence patterns do they use?
- How do they use examples?

**If first interaction with user**:
Ask 1-2 key questions:
```
To make this sound like you: 
- Is there a writer whose style you admire?
- When writing feels natural, what does that look like?
```

**If continuing conversation**:
Analyze their previous messages for voice signals.

**Assess depth requirements**:
Load `references/depth_guide.md` for depth layers.

Determine:
- Is this a quick overview or deep dive?
- What depth layer are they already at?
- What insights would add genuine value?
- How can we go beyond surface level?

**For text content:**
Load `references/writing_styles.md` to understand style frameworks, BUT:
- Adapt style to user's voice (don't override it)
- Choose depth appropriate to purpose
- Blend style with personality

**For visual content:**
Load appropriate visualization guide:
- Mind maps: `references/mindmap_guide.md`
- Infographics: `references/infographic_guide.md`
- Charts/diagrams: `references/visualization_guide.md`

Consider: Will visualization enhance depth or just decorate?

**Example dialogue**:
```
I notice you think in systems and use specific examples from your 
work. I'll match that in the content—systems-focused with concrete 
cases. 

For this topic, I'd suggest combining a written piece with a system 
diagram to show the feedback loops you identified. The writing will 
dig into why those loops matter and what to do about them.

Does that approach work for you?
```

### Step 4: Generate Content with Depth and Voice

**Core principles** (in order of priority):
1. **Authentic voice** - Match user's natural expression and personality
2. **Substantive depth** - Go beyond surface-level to genuine insights
3. **Natural expression** - Write as humans write, not as AI writes
4. **Cultural awareness** - Use localized expressions for target language
5. **Visual clarity** - For diagrams, enhance understanding without decoration
6. **Purpose over formula** - Serve the content's needs, not templates

**Before writing ANY content**:

1. **Load depth guide**: Review `references/depth_guide.md`
   - What depth layer should this reach?
   - What techniques will add genuine insight?
   - How to avoid surface-level content?

2. **Load voice guide**: Review `references/personal_voice.md`
   - What are user's voice markers?
   - How do they structure thoughts?
   - What personality should come through?

3. **Load natural language guide**: Review `references/natural_language.md`
   - What AI patterns must be avoided?
   - How to ensure human-like expression?
   - What cultural considerations apply?

4. **Load format guide** as needed:

**Text formats:**
- Blog posts: `references/blog_guide.md`
- Xiaohongshu: `references/xiaohongshu_guide.md`
- Twitter articles: `references/twitter_article_guide.md`

**Visual formats:**
- Mind maps: `references/mindmap_guide.md`
- Infographics: `references/infographic_guide.md`
- Charts/diagrams: `references/visualization_guide.md`

**Generation approach**:

For **text content**:
```
1. Start with user's insights (don't just summarize source)
2. Apply depth techniques (Why chain, contrarian analysis, synthesis)
3. Express in user's voice (vocabulary, rhythm, personality)
4. Ensure natural language (avoid AI patterns)
5. Add concrete specifics (examples, data, stories)
6. Show thinking process (don't just state conclusions)
7. Challenge assumptions (yours and the reader's)
```

For **visual content**:
```
1. Choose visualization that fits information structure
2. Ensure it adds clarity, not just decoration
3. Keep it purpose-driven and scannable
4. Provide appropriate output format
5. Include depth in labels/annotations
6. Make user's insights visible
```

For **combined content** (text + visual):
```
1. Let visuals enhance depth, not replace it
2. Text explains what visual shows and why it matters
3. Visual makes relationships/patterns concrete
4. Each reinforces the other
5. User's voice in both text and visual choices
```

**Quality checkpoints during generation**:

✅ **Depth check**:
- Am I just summarizing or adding insight?
- What would surprise an informed reader?
- Have I questioned assumptions?
- Are connections non-obvious?

✅ **Voice check**:
- Does this sound like the user?
- Am I using their vocabulary?
- Does rhythm match their style?
- Is their personality present?

✅ **Natural language check**:
- Any AI writing patterns?
- Excessive transitions or hedging?
- Buzzwords or jargon for jargon's sake?
- Sounds human when read aloud?

✅ **Substance check**:
- Concrete examples included?
- Specific vs. generic?
- Actionable vs. abstract?
- Worth the reader's time?

### Step 5: Review and Refine for Depth and Voice

After generating content:

1. **Self-check against all quality dimensions**

**Natural language** (from `natural_language.md`):
   - Removed unnecessary quotation marks?
   - Avoided excessive emojis/formatting?
   - Used natural transitions?
   - Eliminated buzzwords?
   - Visual elements enhance (not distract)?

**Personal voice** (from `personal_voice.md`):
   - Sounds like the user?
   - Uses their vocabulary and rhythm?
   - Reflects their personality?
   - Matches their example style?
   - Feels authentic to them?

**Content depth** (from `depth_guide.md`):
   - Goes beyond summary to insight?
   - Challenges assumptions?
   - Makes non-obvious connections?
   - Includes concrete specifics?
   - Shows thinking process?
   - Questions explored, not just answered?

**Substance and value**:
   - Real insights vs. generic advice?
   - Specific examples included?
   - User's unique perspective clear?
   - Actionable understanding provided?
   - Worth reader's attention?

2. **Present to user with rationale**

Don't just deliver content—explain the approach:

```
Here's your [format]. I focused on [depth approach] while maintaining 
your [voice characteristic]. 

Key choices:
- [Depth technique used]: To go beyond [surface level]
- [Voice element preserved]: Because it's distinctly you
- [Structure decision]: To serve [specific purpose]

[content]

What resonates? What needs adjustment?
```

3. **Offer refinement options**

Be specific about what can be adjusted:

```
I can refine this in several ways:

Depth adjustments:
- Add more [contrarian analysis / cross-domain connections / specific examples]
- Dig deeper into [particular aspect]
- Challenge [additional assumptions]

Voice adjustments:
- More/less [formal / casual / technical / personal]
- Adjust [sentence rhythm / example style / personality markers]
- Shift [emotional temperature / confidence level]

Structure adjustments:
- Reorganize [specific section]
- Add/remove [visualization / section / examples]
- Change emphasis on [particular point]

Or generate in a different format entirely.
```

4. **Facilitate depth exploration**

If user wants to go deeper:

```
Let's dig into [topic] more. Some directions:

1. Question we haven't explored: [provocative question]
2. Contrarian angle: What if [conventional wisdom] is wrong?
3. Hidden assumption: This assumes [X]—is that always true?
4. Cross-domain connection: This relates to [other field]
5. Practical implication: If this is true, then [consequence]

Which interests you?
```

5. **Support voice development**

If user is discovering their voice:

```
I notice you're exploring different ways to express this. Let me try 
two versions—one more [characteristic A], one more [characteristic B]. 
See which feels more 'you':

[Version 1 with specific voice approach]
[Version 2 with alternative voice approach]

Or describe what you're going for and I'll adjust.
```

## Quality Standards

Every piece of content must meet these standards (in priority order):

✅ **Authentic voice** (CRITICAL):
- Sounds distinctly like the user
- Matches their natural expression
- Reflects their personality
- Uses their vocabulary and rhythm
- Could plausibly be claimed as their own writing

✅ **Substantive depth**:
- Goes beyond surface-level summary
- Offers non-obvious insights
- Questions assumptions
- Makes unexpected connections
- Shows genuine thinking
- Includes concrete specifics
- Worth reader's time and attention

✅ **Natural expression**:
- Human rhythm, varied sentence length
- No AI writing patterns
- Culturally appropriate language
- Reads smoothly when spoken aloud
- No excessive formatting/decoration

✅ **Faithful to source**:
- Accurate to source material
- User's understanding prominently featured
- Proper context maintained
- No misrepresentation

✅ **Cultural respect**:
- Localized expressions for target language
- Platform-appropriate conventions
- Audience-suitable tone
- No translation artifacts

✅ **Visual clarity** (for diagrams):
- Purpose-driven, not decorative
- Enhances understanding
- Appropriate complexity
- Accessible design

❌ **Never acceptable**:
- Generic voice that could be anyone
- Surface-level content without insight
- AI writing patterns (transitions, hedging, buzzwords)
- Rigid template adherence over content needs
- Excessive formatting as substitute for substance
- Marketing copy tone (unless explicitly requested)
- Busy visualizations that confuse
- Content that lacks user's unique perspective

**Priority hierarchy when trade-offs necessary**:
1. User's authentic voice (always primary)
2. Substantive depth (insights over information)
3. Natural expression (human over robotic)
4. Everything else

**The ultimate test**: 
- Would the user be proud to claim this as their own?
- Does it sound like them at their best?
- Does it offer something worth reading?
- Would informed readers find genuine value?

## Writing Style Philosophy

**Read `references/natural_language.md` carefully before every generation.**

Key principles:
1. **Write for humans, not algorithms**
2. **Use active voice, but not exclusively**
3. **Vary sentence structure naturally**
4. **Let personality show through**
5. **Match the medium's natural conventions**
6. **Visualize only when it adds clarity**

## Visualization Philosophy

**Read `references/visualization_guide.md` for visual content.**

Key principles:
1. **Clarity over complexity**
2. **Purpose drives design**
3. **Every element must earn its place**
4. **Accessibility matters**
5. **Tell a story visually**

## Interaction Patterns

### When user provides minimal input:
```
I can work with what you've shared. Let me create [format] based on
this. If anything feels off, we can adjust.
```

### When user has specific vision:
```
I hear you want [specific approach]. Let me try that and you can
guide me from there.
```

### When offering alternatives:
```
I wrote this in a [style] tone. Want to see how it sounds more [alternative]?
I can also generate [other format] if that works better, or create a 
visualization to complement the text.
```

### When user asks for changes:
Make changes directly, don't over-explain unless asked:
```
Here's the revised version:
[content]
```

### For visual content:
```
I've created [visualization type] showing [key relationships/insights].
The structure emphasizes [approach].

[Present visualization]

Would you like me to:
- Adjust the layout or emphasis
- Add more detail in certain areas
- Try a different visualization type
- Combine this with written content
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: From Reading to Blog with Visualization
```
User: "I just read an article about system thinking and have some 
insights. Can you help me write a blog post with a diagram?"

Response: I'd love to help! Share the article and your key insights. 
I can create a systems diagram to show the relationships, then build 
the blog post around it. What's your target audience?

[After receiving input]

Let me start with a concept map showing the key relationships you 
identified, then write the blog post that explains each connection.

[Generate visualization + blog post]
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-format Content with Visual Support
```
User: "I want to share my learning about [topic] on different platforms."

Response: Great! I can create several formats:

1. A blog post with embedded diagrams (deep dive)
2. Xiaohongshu note with simplified visuals (accessible)
3. Twitter article with key graphic (professional)
4. Mind map (reference)

Which format should I start with? Or should I create a core 
visualization first, then adapt it for different platforms?
```

### Scenario 3: Pure Visualization Request
```
User: "Can you create an infographic description showing the 
relationship between these concepts?"

Response: Absolutely. I'll create a detailed infographic structure 
showing how these concepts connect. I'll specify:
- Layout and flow
- Visual elements for each section
- How to present the relationships
- Color and style suggestions

You can use this to create the actual graphic or share the 
description as a guide.

[Generate infographic description]
```

### Scenario 4: Twitter Long-Form Article
```
User: "I want to write a Twitter article about my research findings."

Response: Perfect for Twitter's long-form format. What's the key 
finding you want to lead with? And who's your target audience?

[After receiving input]

I'll write a cohesive article that:
- Opens with your key insight
- Builds the argument systematically  
- Includes scannable headers
- Balances data with storytelling

[Generate Twitter article]
```

## Error Prevention

**Before finalizing any content**:

1. Read it aloud mentally - does it sound natural?
2. Check for AI tells:
   - Excessive "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally"
   - Lists when prose would work better
   - Overuse of colons and semicolons
   - Generic transition phrases
3. Verify user insights are prominently featured
4. Ensure platform-specific requirements are met
5. Confirm tone matches user's intent
6. For visualizations: Is it clearer than text alone?

## Success Metrics

Content succeeds when:
- User feels it sounds like them
- Readers engage naturally (comments, shares)
- No one suspects it's AI-generated
- User's unique insights shine through
- It's ready to publish with minimal editing
- Visualizations clarify rather than decorate
